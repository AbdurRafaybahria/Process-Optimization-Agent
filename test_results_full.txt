   PARALLEL EXECUTION ANALYSIS:
   ============================

   Time 0.0h - 6 tasks running in PARALLEL:
     • Delivery to Welding Body Car stock (0.2h) - Weding stock and transit area
     • Picking from Molding stock Car body components (0.8h) - Molding stock and transit area
     • Welding Body Closures assembly (0.3h) - Station for welding Closure Assembling Robot
     • Welding Car Body Complete (0.5h) - Station for welding body complete Robot
     • Welding Car Engine Compartment (0.8h) - Station for welding Car Engine Compartment Robot
     • Welding Car Underbody (0.3h) - Station for welding Underbody Robot
