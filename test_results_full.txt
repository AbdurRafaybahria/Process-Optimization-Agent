7. Running Intelligent Optimization...

   OPTIMIZATION RESULTS:
   --------------------

   PRODUCTION METRICS (Manufacturing Perspective):
   ===============================================
     * Cycle Time (Makespan): 0.8 hours
     * Total Production Cost: $295.65
     * Cost Per Task: $49.27
     * Throughput: 7.66 tasks/hour
     * Max Parallel Tasks: 6
     * Parallelization: 100.0%
     * Time Efficiency: 73.4%
     * Resource Utilization: 0.4%
     * Idle Time: 0.0 hours
     * Total Tasks: 6

   PARALLEL EXECUTION ANALYSIS:
   ============================

   Time 0.0h - 6 tasks running in PARALLEL:
     • User Authentication (0.4h) - Senior Backend
     • Product Catalog API (0.7h) - Fullstack Developer
     • Payment Integration (0.5h) - Payment Specialist
     • Database Design and Setup (0.5h) - Database Admin
     • Frontend UI (0.8h) - Frontend Developer
     • Testing and QA (0.6h) - QA Engineer

   INDEPENDENT TASKS (Can run in parallel from start):
     • Database Design and Setup (0.5h)
     • User Authentication (0.4h)
     • Product Catalog API (0.7h)
     • Frontend UI (0.8h)
     • Payment Integration (0.5h)
     • Testing and QA (0.6h)

   Recommendations:
     1. Task 'User Authentication' takes 0.4h (51% of cycle time). Consider breaking it into smaller subtasks for better parallelization.
     2. Task 'Product Catalog API' takes 0.7h (85% of cycle time). Consider breaking it into smaller subtasks for better parallelization.
