   OPTIMIZATION RESULTS:
   --------------------

   PRODUCTION METRICS (Manufacturing Perspective):
   ===============================================
     * Cycle Time (Makespan): 12.0 hours
     * Total Production Cost: $1064.00
     * Cost Per Task: $212.80
     * Throughput: 0.42 tasks/hour
     * Max Parallel Tasks: 4
     * Parallelization: 69.2%
     * Time Efficiency: 66.7%
     * Resource Utilization: 5.0%
     * Idle Time: 15.0 hours
     * Total Tasks: 5

   PARALLEL EXECUTION ANALYSIS:
   ============================

   Time 0.0h - 4 tasks running in PARALLEL:
     • Claim Submission Review (4.0h) - Claim Examiner
     • Verification in Household Claims Processing (6.0h) - Claim Adjuster
     • Claim Assessment in Household Claims Processing (8.0h) - Claim Assessor
     • Settlement and Payment in Household Claims Processing (8.0h) - Claims Payment Coordinator

   Time 6.0h - 1 task running:
     • Approval/Denial in Household Claims Processing (6.0h) - Claim Adjuster

   INDEPENDENT TASKS (Can run in parallel from start):
     • Claim Submission Review (4.0h)
     • Verification in Household Claims Processing (6.0h)
     • Claim Assessment in Household Claims Processing (8.0h)
     • Approval/Denial in Household Claims Processing (6.0h)
     • Settlement and Payment in Household Claims Processing (8.0h)

   Recommendations:
     1. High idle time detected (33% of available time). Consider reducing resources or increasing workload to improve cost efficiency.
     2. Task 'Claim Submission Review' takes 4.0h (33% of cycle time). Consider breaking it into smaller subtasks for better parallelization.
     3. Task 'Verification in Household Claims Processing' takes 6.0h (50% of cycle time). Consider breaking it into smaller subtasks for better parallelization.
